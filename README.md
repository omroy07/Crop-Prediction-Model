# 🌾 Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning

This project presents a Machine Learning-based approach to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation based on various environmental and soil parameters. It includes both a Jupyter Notebook for model training and analysis, as well as a web application that allows users to get real-time crop recommendations through a user-friendly interface.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `final Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `app.py` — Flask web app to provide user-friendly interface.
- `index.html` — Contains HTML templates for the web app.
- `model.pkl` — Trained ML model saved using `pickle` or `joblib`.
- `requirements.txt` — List of required dependencies.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Recommend the best crop to cultivate based on:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level
- Rainfall

The objective is to build a predictive model that helps farmers choose the ideal crop for maximum productivity and sustainability.
