# 🌾 Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning

This project presents a Machine Learning-based approach to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation based on various environmental and soil parameters. It includes both a Jupyter Notebook for model training and analysis, as well as a web application that allows users to get real-time crop recommendations through a user-friendly interface.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Recommend the best crop to cultivate based on:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level
- Rainfall

The objective is to build a predictive model that helps farmers choose the ideal crop for maximum productivity and sustainability.
